To get started copy the djstart_template.m to djstart.m and enter your
database host and credentials.

To define which tables to populate and what folders to add to the path
I use a relatively simple parameter script. See the file called gpfamodel
for an example. 

To see how to submit a job to the Sun Grid Engine, see the file called
examples.sh. Of course, this is specific to the configuration of the 
Grid Engine and may have to be adjusted to your local setup.
